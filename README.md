        <p><em>Dear Jury Members,</em></p>
        <p><em>Our game Yggateway, developed by Unity Team 106, aims to blend legendary mythology with modern science fiction to provide gamers with a unique experience. Players             journey through nine different realms of the Yggdrasil tree via portals, each realm presenting different themes and challenges such as puzzle-solving and resource gathering.</em></p>
        <p><em>Set in a near future where the world is on the brink of destruction, our game's concept aims to highlight the Sustainable Development Goals planned to be achieved by 2030. Through tasks that blend mythology and modernity, the game also aims to raise awareness about the Sustainable Development Goals. The time limit we have set to complete tasks within the game reflects the urgency in our real-world mission to tackle these goals with the limited time we have.</em></p>

# Sprints
<details open>
    <summary><h2>Sprint 1</h2></summary>
    <p><strong>Estimated Completion Points:</strong> <em>The points estimated to be completed within the sprint are set at 99.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Point Completion Logic:</strong> <em>We based our sprint point estimation on the Fibonacci sequence. This method helped us to more accurately evaluate the complexity and time consumption of the tasks. The Fibonacci sequence assisted us in determining the difficulty level of each task. This point system generally assigns higher points to more complex tasks and lower points to simpler tasks, ensuring that the team progresses with the correct priorities throughout the sprint.</em></p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>Daily Scrum:</strong> <em>Through regular meetings held on Discord and WhatsApp, we effectively maintained team communication. These meetings, scheduled considering the different availabilities of team members, allowed the sharing of daily progress, discussion of encountered problems, and planning of the next steps. In each meeting, we assessed the progress made during the sprint and strengthened our coordination to achieve our goals.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Sprint Review:</strong></p>
    <p><em>In this sprint, we laid a solid foundation for the Yggateway game. We completed the backlog points of 99 as planned. We started the 3D design of the first map and determined the name and story of the game. Additionally, we created the basic logo design but plan to update it in future sprints. We strengthened team communication by holding regular meetings on Discord and WhatsApp. Through daily Scrum meetings, we tracked our progress and came together to solve issues. For future sprints, we decided to have the design and development teams progress concurrently. Believing that design will play a critical role in the development of the game, we distributed tasks among the design team. By evaluating our successes and forward plans during this process, we identified improvements and strategies to achieve our goals in the next stages of the game.</em></p>

<p><strong>Sprint Review:</strong></p>
<p><em>In this sprint, we did not achieve some of our goals. We aimed to complete 58 backlog points in our sprint plans, but due to team members' personal lives, they had difficulty maintaining active communication with the team and meeting deadlines. Based on our sprint evaluation, we decided to have detailed discussions with members individually to determine whether they will continue with the team collaboration.</em></p>
